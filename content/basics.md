#  The Basics of C++
 
In this unit we will discuss the most basic features of C++, those we
need to use to write any sort of interesting program.

But before we write *interesting* programs, we have to be able to
write, compile, and run *any program at all*.
(*Compiling* a program is turning human-readable source code into
runnable machine code. A language like Python does this when you run
the Python source code: it compiles and runs in one step, which is
characteristic of *interpreted languages*. C++ divides this into
two separate steps, which is more laborious, but which also makes the
resulting program run significantly faster.)
And that can involve
a fair bit of setup and installation work. So the very first thing you
should do, with whatever C++ development tool you use, is to try to
compile and run [Hello World!](hello.html), the standard
first program to try in any language.

Once you have gotten "Hello World!" to run, you next need to master
these C++ basics:

*   Logical operators: <span class="code">&&</span> (and), <span class="code">||</span> (or), and <span class="code">!</span> (not).
